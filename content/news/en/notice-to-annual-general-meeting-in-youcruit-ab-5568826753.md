Due to circumstances caused by covid-19, and to reduce spread of infection, the board of directors has decided to hold the annual general meeting through postal vote, utilizing temporary laws permitting Swedish companies to do so during 2021. This means that the annual general meeting will be held without presence of any shareholders, agents, etc. Shareholders may exercise their voting rights only by postal voting.
