To streamline the corporate structure and simplify administration, the board of YouCruit AB has decided to merge the two subsidiaries, Hencla AB and Youbistaff AB, with the parent company YouCruit AB.

The subsidiaries are the remainder of YouCruit's previous business model. Now that the company is focusing on recruitment platforms and underlying IT solutions, the subsidiaries are redundant and no longer needed.

The merger is expected to be completed in July.
