**The Chad and Cheese podcast** is one of, if not the leading podcast when it comes to HRTech, investments in HRTech, Future of Work and talent acquisition. If you work within or invest in HRTech, you are very likely to already be a Chad and Cheese subscriber. We've been listening to their podcast for years here at the office and I'm thrilled to share that they picked up on the recent funding news without us having talked to them. 

Put on your headphones and enjoy! (**Minute 16:40**)
