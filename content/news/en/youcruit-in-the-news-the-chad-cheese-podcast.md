*Chad (16m 41s): "That's one hell of a pivot, but I got to say, it's what it really is, it's a staffing company, veiled as a tech company. Don't get me wrong, it's actually pretty damn smart because if you tell companies, come use our platform for free and only pay us when you hire drivers. Well, that seems like a good incentive. I mean, it's not revolutionary tech by any form or fashion, but does it really have to be when it's the trucking industry? No. So, you know, you get a free hiring platform. It's like an ATS lite, free job postings and a free career site. Just pay us when you get hires. It's the definition of getting a company hooked on crack. Now here's the genius part. ATS and CRMs for years have built a separate candidate database for every single one of their clients. Not in this model, using the free jobs and their clients as bait to attract candidates while building an all-you-can-eat database. When you only pay, when you hire people, they have found a way I believe to go around what we've been used to for years, which are these, oh, well, that's my candidate. It's the key to that ownership conversation, right? You don't own the candidate motherfucker. It's a free platform. It's my candidate. Right? So overall, this isn't revolutionary tech by any means, but the model is, it's pretty damn smart, I think."*

*Joel (18m 27s): "I mean, it's just insane. So the marriage of mobile and technology and the gig platform phenomenon is like, no other industry comes together better than trucking. And you've got people that, you know, only want to truck certain times of the day or only want to do certain parts of the world or certain states. They want to take their dog with them and they want to be able to do shit. Like it's really crazy. So to have a technology like this makes total sense. And you know, I think if you were, if we were going to play who'd you rather, and it was Dice or Lane Finder. Lane Finder would get my rose for sure."*
